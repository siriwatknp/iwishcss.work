This site is a collection of use cases I wish I can use CSS in an elegant way to achieve them without hacks or workarounds.

## About me

I'm a UI developer at [MUI]() (the company behinds Material UI). I enjoy using CSS and still learn about it.

## My work

At MUI, my main focus is Joy UI, a React component library for building design systems. The goal is to enhance developer experience and increase productivity by crafting CSS techniques into the library.
