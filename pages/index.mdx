This site is a collection of [use cases](/posts) I wish I can use CSS in an elegant way to achieve them without hacks or workarounds.

## About me

I'm a UI developer at [MUI](https://mui.com/about/) (the company behinds [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)). I enjoy using CSS and still learn .

## My work

At MUI, my main focus is [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview/), a React component library for building design systems. The goal is to enhance developer experience and increase productivity by crafting CSS techniques into the library.
